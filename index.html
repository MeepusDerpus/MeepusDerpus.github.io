Welcome to my CS3 Graphics Assignment, by Mansoor Rahman
I have refactored my code and Improved many things. 
I hope it is to your Satisfaction.

For the requirement of Day/Night Scenes.
I simply added and removed The Moon/Stars/Sun for day/night toggle
For Day, it is a white directional light with a distance of 0 for constant attenuation.
For The night Scene I have 3 point lights as garden lights, with decay and color.

I have added procedural generation for stars and trees.
there are in functions StarsGen and TreeGen

CreateStructures creates the plane, igloo, pond, watertank and house
CreateLighting Sets properties for our Directional and point lights
CreateGUI creates our Dat.GUI for user interaction

CreateControls handles our right-click menu, I have removed the Zoom slider as it conflicts with orbital Controls
Note I have created orbit controls which the user interact with using the mouse

InitStats is for our Framerate debug
Render is our typical WebGL render.
Note each time day/night is called, Stars are recreated procedurally.
